# I-94-Traffic-Dataset
Finding indicators of heavy traffic
We're going to analyze a dataset about the westbound traffic on the I-94 Interstate highway.

John Hogue made the dataset available, and can be downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The goal is to determine a few indicators of heavy traffic on I-94. These indicators can be weather type, time of the day, time of the week, etc.
